    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. 
        Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. 
            Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. 
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; 
            cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>
    </ol>
