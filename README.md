# odin-recipies
A wonderful project that i used to practice all the skills i learnt from the html and git sections in the foundation Odin course.

i was able link between pages, insert images and size them, use both unorderd and ordered lists
used paragraph and headings in an ideal way to make a recipe website.

watch out for more iv'e only begun on my journey to becoming a full stack developer
